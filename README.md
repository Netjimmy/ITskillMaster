# ITskillMaster
This is the final term project of iii Big Data Training Program. I lead a team of 6 members to finish a job recommendation system. We plan to recommend job seekers most appropriate offers based on theirs skillsets. We firstly use Python as web crawler to collect data from several major job information webs in Taiwan. We build our "IT skill" dictionary as well as clean and normalize the text bag. Then we implement several NLP techniques such as tokenization, stemming and TF-IDF. We apply K-means clustering to recommend job seekers most appropriate offers based on theirs skillsets and calculate cosine similarity to suggest user the next critical skill he should learn.
